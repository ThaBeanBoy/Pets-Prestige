USE GSAP FOR ANIMATIONS

Allow children elements with the same name, just create an id type thing to avoid manipulation duplication

Programming less errors
    have 1 piece of code that edits the root array instead of 2 different place (in refresh.js and )
        Then update the code in the refresh to take after that
    Have the class authenticating whether to accept a new child from sortable edits
        use Promises to make the code neater and add functionality for editing, adding child/objects and all
    make a caret class that inherits from the todS class

Editing Info by pressing the 3 dots bar
    (Prblm) offset of the tippy box is of for sub children of list
    (Prblm) Z-index of sub tasks:not(task show-off)

Sortable stuff
    fix the liClick problem

New Inputs for tasks (Use SweetAlert.js)
    Spots => Search(ctrl + shift + F) prompt and alert

    Notes
    Use of Cleave.js for better inputs
    Combine SweetAlert.js in combination with Cleave.js

    let users put in emojis if they want

Imports and exports and simplify the color codes in the SASS files

use GSAP to animate height auto for caret and the rotating thingy
    ctrl + shift + F find transform: rotate(0deg) and transform: rotate(0deg)

Ping for when user checks a task
    Add distinct aadio cues for each possible action (A good amount, nothing to excessive)

undo option after deleting task (approx 6 seconds)

Search thingy
    Use this technique from designcourse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYUuGgC_IY0

    Has to look through all items that shows resemble the users text
    Caps don't have to be the same
    Space shouldn't matter
    Apostrophes can voetsek too

Settings
    Swiper has to be used to travel from home to settings
    T/F For pinging for check of a task
    T/F Have bottom piece or keep below buttons available
    Let user put certain amount of seconds until the bottom buttons close

Improve animation, especicially after refresh(), make something like an animation bin.
The animation bin will log the change pre-refresh, re-add those changes then remove them...
    -When user edits title
    -When user adds a child
    -For deleted tasks
    -When user del all
    -When user del all done
    -For tippies that are left open after refreshing


When the user presses back of the phone(PC and mostly Android niggas), the app should revert the last command type deal
