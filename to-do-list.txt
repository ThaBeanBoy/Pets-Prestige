Planned to do 
    select from times of week
    select from days of a month
        Every month End
    Every x days
    1 timed event

Time options similar to the Do Now app.

When the user presses back of the phone(PC and mostly Android niggas), the app should revert the last command type deal

Online accounts and tings
    Use Parsley for form validation (Lord knows you suck at it bruuuuuuh, lol what a roast)
    User should be able to access that data from any device using their online accounts
    Use firebase as the storage and for user validation, NodeJs and making your own servers just takes too much time for this nonsense.
    Have access to an online shop of themes and make your own custom theme.

Integrate Google assistant and Siri with the app, atleast do some research on this ting lad...
