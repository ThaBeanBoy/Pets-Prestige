Online accounts and tings
    Use Parsley for form validation (Lord knows you suck at it bruuuuuuh, lol what a roast)
    User should be able to access that data from any device using their online accounts
    Use firebase as the storage and for user validation, NodeJs and making your own servers just takes too much time for this nonsense.
    Have access to an online shop of themes and make your own custom theme.

Integrate Google assistant and Siri with the app, atleast do some research on this ting lad...
