    Every x days
    1 timed event

Time options similar to the Do Now app.

Online accounts and tings
    Use Parsley for form validation (Lord knows you suck at it bruuuuuuh, lol what a roast)
    User should be able to access that data from any device using their online accounts
    Use firebase as the storage and for user validation, NodeJs and making your own servers just takes too much time for this nonsense.
    Have access to an online shop of themes and make your own custom theme.

Social type of thing where people can interact with one another
    D3.js can be used to see information.
    Bruh, we might data mine to see patterns in human behavior to improve the likleyhood for people to do their tasks.
