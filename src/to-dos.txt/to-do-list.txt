o Problem, done tasks under a not-done task are not getting a black border, it's white, 
    It's more of a UI problem

x Get the hang of Webpack
    x Tippy
        x if user open a tippy for a caret that's in a sub task position, there's no border.
        x Offset for a caret in a sub task position
        x Events
            x Edit
            x Minus all
            x Add
            x Minus all done
            x Delete
    x Get the basic event going
        x Root, Add a task
        x Root, minus done tasks
        x Root, Del all done
    x Get Sortable going 

Get the hang of work box

Make an update thingy

Make icons square, not circles

Programming less errors
    Have the class authenticating whether to accept a new child from sortable edits
        use Promises to make the code neater and add functionality for editing, adding child/objects and all
    make a caret class that inherits from the todS class

Allow children elements with the same name, just create an id type thing to avoid manipulation duplication

New Inputs for tasks (Use SweetAlert.js)
    Spots => Search(ctrl + shift + F) prompt and alert

    Notes
    Use of Cleave.js for better inputs
    Combine SweetAlert.js in combination with Cleave.js

    let users put in emojis if they want

There's a bug with Sortable and tippy,
    When the chosen element is outside the .allFather, tippy should just close 

    Sortable, if user moves an element before the delay time kicks in, there's no sortable action at all
    When user clicks a caret or task, the open tippy should go first


Ping for when user checks a task
    Add distinct aadio cues for each possible action (A good amount, nothing to excessive)

undo option after deleting task (approx 6 seconds)

Search thingy
    Use this technique from designcourse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYUuGgC_IY0

    Has to look through all items that shows resemble the users text
    Caps don't have to be the same
    Space shouldn't matter
    Apostrophes can voetsek too

use GSAP to animate height auto for caret and the rotating thingy
    ctrl + shift + F find transform: rotate(0deg) and transform: rotate(0deg)
    when task is added
    when caret is formed
    opening the search bar

Settings
    Settings page
    Swiper has to be used to travel from home to settings
    
    T/F Close other carets when opening another caret within the same branch/parent
    T/F For pinging for check of a task
    T/F Have bottom piece or keep below buttons available
    Let user put certain amount of seconds until the bottom buttons close
    T/FWhether user wants to be able to move stuff(sortablStuff.js) into a task (Not caret!!)
    Order of pages eg(1.Home, 2.Calender, 3.Settings)
    T/F Animations
    How long should the buttons holding the editing to the root should be held open
        or should just be left open

Add quick settings and inline settings for the most important stuff

Improve animation, especicially after refresh(), make something like an animation bin.
The animation bin will log the change pre-refresh, re-add those changes then remove them...
    -When user edits title
    -When user adds a child
    -For deleted tasks
    -When user del all
    -When user del all done
    -For tippies that are left open after refreshing


When the user presses back of the phone(PC and mostly Android niggas), the app should revert the last command type deal

Migrate to typescript
